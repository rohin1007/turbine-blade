# CFD analysis of wind turbine blade.


Flow around a standard wind turbine blade was simulated using ANSYS Fluent. The turbine rotates at 98 rad/s and the flow velocity is 6 m/s normal to the turbine. Pressure and velocity contours at 20% of blade length were generated. The pressure contours show the difference in pressure values between the top and bottom surfaces of the aerofoil cross-section. This pressure difference provides the force to rotate the blades. The power produced by the turbine can be found by finding the torque acting on the blade. A flow separation region can be seen on the velocity contour and the velocity vectors show flow separating from the blade wall at the aft.
